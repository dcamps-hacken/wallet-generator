# WALLET GENERATOR

> ‚è≥‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently under construction ‚ö†Ô∏è‚è≥

This **Wallet Generator** allows any user to deploy Simple, Destroyable or Multisig wallets on EVM-compatible blockchains.

## QUICKSTART üöÄ

```git
git clone https://github.com/fields93/wallet-generator.git
```

## TYPES OF WALLETS

The **Wallet Generator** contract comes with 3 main functions:

### ü•á Simple Wallet

Use the `createWallet()` function if you want to create a wallet linked to your metamask address.

Since it has no arguments you don't need to input anything. A message will pop on <em>Metamask</em> asking you to approve a transaction that will create your wallet.

This wallet allows you to receive or transfer funds, get your balance or withdraw all your money.

### ü•à Destroyable Wallet

Use `createDestroyableWallet()` to generate a Simple Wallet that can also be destroyed at any point.

In order to add an extra layer of security, the destroy functionality is a two-step process. Therefore, you will first need to call the function `preDestroy()`, that will change the status of the wallet to `PREDESTROY`, and later use the function `destroyWallet()`.

Once the wallet is destroyed, all its funds will be sent to the address you provided.

### ü•â Multi-Signature Wallet

With `createMultisigWallet()` you can create shared wallet that requires multi-signature to send transactions.

In order to call this function, some arguments must be provided:

-   `_owners` is a list of addresses, separated by comas, that correspond to the owners of the wallet (i.e. people who can sign, approve or send transactions).

-   `_requiredConfirmations` is the number of times you want a transaction to be approved before it can be executed.

### HOW TO GET THE ADDRESS OF YOUR WALLET

Three functions have been added in the **Wallet Generator** contract with the purpose of getting the address of any wallet you created.

Use `getLatestWallet()` if you just want to get the address of the wallet you just generated.

With `getWalletFromId()` you can obtain the address of a given wallet. You need to the input the parameter `_Id` to get it, which corresponds to the order in which you created your wallets (use `0` to get the first wallet you created, `1` for the second, and so on).
